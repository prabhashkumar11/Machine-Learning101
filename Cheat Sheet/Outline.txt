> _**TIP #1**: Create an outline for your notebook & for each section before you start coding_



Here's an outline of the project:

1. Download the dataset
2. Explore & analyze the dataset
3. Prepare the dataset for ML training
4. Train hardcoded & baseline models
5. Make predictions & submit to Kaggle
6. Peform feature engineering
7. Train & evaluate different models
8. Tune hyperparameters for the best models
9. Train on a GPU with the entire dataset
10. Document & publish the project online
